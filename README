Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries
-----------------------------------

Release version 2.14.4
Project website: www.7kfans.com

This is a GPL release of the Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries thanks to
Enlight Software which granted the ability to license the game under a
free and open source license in 2009. See the file "COPYING" for the
details of the license. We are indebted to Enlight for making the 7kfans
project possible and giving a new chance to build a community for fans
of the game.

Who should use this version of 7KAA?
 * Any linux user.
 * Anyone who wants to try the latest bugfixes.
 * Anyone who likes the slightly improved game play.

Who shouldn't use this version of 7KAA?
 * Any multiplayer user under Windows. The new netcode, while it promises
   actual cross-platform capatability, does not work well in lobby, nor
   does not work on anything other than LAN (VPN okay) and 2 players. Please
   use 2.13.xx series with DPlay instead if stability and full-features are
   needed.

Changes in this release:
 * Added the game data to the source tree.
 * Added an NSIS install script.
 * Started rewriting the lobby code to be UDP instead of TCP. It is not done
   and does not work properly for >2 player or over anything but LAN. The game
   port is now UDP 19255.

Thanks to all who made this release possible.
