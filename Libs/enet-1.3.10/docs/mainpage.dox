ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust
network communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
The primary feature it provides is optional reliable, in-order
delivery of packets.

ENet omits certain higher level networking features such as authentication, 
lobbying, server discovery, encryption, or other similar tasks that are
particularly application specific so that the library remains flexible,
portable, and easily embeddable.
