_("To conduct espionage against your current or future enemies, you must train or hire Spies.")
~
_("Spies are trained by selecting a Village, Clicking on the Train Tile and then Clicking on the Spying option. Spies may also be hired in Inns, along with other mercenaries.")
~
_("Spies may either be sent into your own Villages or Buildings to act as Counterspies, or be placed in Independent Villages or Foreign Kingdoms, for more dangerous duties.")
~
_("To send a Spy into a foreign Kingdom or an Independent Village, first change the color of his cloak to that of the intended target. Choose white for Independent Villages. Change the color by clicking on one of the color squares at the bottom right.")
~
Button: SPYNOTI0
_("Above the color choices you will see the Sneak Tile. This Tile means that when you change the color of your Spy's cloak, it will be done secretly.")
~
Button: SPYNOTI1
_("If you Click on the Sneak Tile it will change into the Surrender Tile. When this Tile is active, the changing of a Spy's color will notify the Kingdom of that color that a person from your Kingdom has betrayed you and joined them.")
~
Button: SETTLE
_("To infiltrate a Foreign or Independent Village with your Spy, you must click on the Settle Button while your Spy is selected. The Hand Cursor will then change into a Flag and Arrow Cursor; use it to click on the targeted Village. Your Spy will now travel to and infiltrate the targeted Village.")
~
Button: SPYCHACT
_("Once your Spy has settled in a Village, he will have several new options available to him. Once you select a Village you've infiltrated with your Spy, you will see, on the right, the Spying Tile. Click on this Tile to bring up your Spy's options.")
~
_("In a Village a Spy will have but two choices: Sleeping or Sowing Dissent. The default task is Sleeping. To toggle from Sleeping to Sowing Dissent, Click the Tile again.")
~
_("When Sleeping, a Spy will not conduct any espionage activity. He will be insinuating himself with the local people, gaining their confidence and becoming more familiar with their ways. A Spy will not be exposed while he is in this mode.")
~
_("Once he's infiltrated, your Spy's skill level will start to increase slowly. This is important, because a Spy with a high Skill Level will be more effective in his work; he will also decrease his risk of exposure.")
~
_("When Sowing Discord, your Spy will be helping the people around him to see the advantages of becoming part of your Empire. It is his task to lower an Independent Village's resistance to your rule, and to lower the Loyalty Level in the Villages or Buildings of other Kingdoms.")
~
_("It is important to understand that a Spy will be far more effective with people of his own nationality, as he speaks their language and understands their customs.")
~
_("To infiltrate an enemy Building, such as a Mine, Factory, War Factory or Tower of Science, Right-Click on the Building with your Spy selected.")
~
_("If the Building is full of workers, it will be impossible to infiltrate; with a Spy already settled in an enemy Village, however, there's a chance the Spy will be hired for work in a Building. You will, however, have no control over which Building the Spy is sent to work in.")
~
_("Once he's in a Building, your Spy will have the opportunity to Bribe, Sabotage or Steal Information. He can also Sleep (which means he will function as a normal worker).")
~
_("If you choose Sabotage, the Spy will do his best to slow production in the Building. In a Mine he will slow the extraction of Raw Material, in a Factory or War Factory he will slow the production of Goods and Weapons, and in a Tower of Science he will slow Research.")
~
_("If you choose Bribe, your Spy will be asking an enemy unit to join him in his spying activities. If the enemy refuses the bribe, your Spy will be exposed and executed.")
~
_("To Bribe an enemy unit, select the Enemy Building the Spy has infiltrated. Then Click on the picture of the Enemy Unit you wish to bribe.")
~
Button: BRIBE
_("Click on the Bribe Tile. You will now see a pop-up of different monetary amounts. Click on the amount you wish to offer to the enemy unit. If he accepts the bribe, he will become yours and, like your first Spy, will slowly increase his Skill Level.")
~
Button: VSECRET
_("If you wish to steal Information, Click on the Steal Information Tile. You will be presented with a list of subjects; they're the same as the subjects beneath the Scrolls on the top of your screen.")
~
_("The information the Spy can access will depend on his skill level. The higher his Skill Level, the more sensitive the information he will have access to.")
~
_("If his Skill Level reaches 90, your Spy will gain access to Espionage information; he can then discover who the enemy's Spies are, and where they are located.")
~
Button: CAPTURE
_("If your Spy or Spies are the only residents of an Enemy's Building, you will have the option of Capturing the Building. While the Building is selected, Clicking the Capture Tile will make it yours. If your Spy is a General in an enemy Fort, you may capture it even if there are loyal enemy units still in the Fort.")
~
Button: ASSASSIN
_("A Spy in a Fort or a Seat of Power will be able to attempt an assassination on the enemy commander, be he General or King. To do this, Click on the building and then on the Assassinate Button. You do not need to select the enemy target as the commander is the only possible one.")
~
Button: MOBILSPY
_("If you wish your Spy to evacuate an infiltrated area you must first select the Building or Village where he resides, Click on the Spy Tile, select your Spy and then Click on the Evacuate Tile option.")
