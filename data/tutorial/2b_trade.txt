_("At the beginning of the game you will have only one Village, so domestic trade will not yet be possible. That leaves Trade with foreign Kingdoms.")
~
_("You won't be able to import anything, either, unless you have a trade treaty with a foreign Kingdom.")
~
_("To make a trade treaty, you must either press the F1 key on your keyboard or else Click on the Kingdoms Scroll at the top left of your screen.")
~
_("You will now see information on all the Kingdoms of the world that have been discovered by your people.")
~
_("To initiate contact, you must first Click on one of the Kingdoms listed. Below that area you will then see a row of new buttons. Click on the Diplomacy Button.")
~
_("You will be presented with a long list of options, the first of which is, 'Propose a trade treaty.' Click on this option and your message will be sent to the selected Kingdom.")
~
_("There will be a brief delay while the message is being delivered and an answer is being returned. When the answer arrives, it will be displayed at the bottom of your main screen.")
~
_("If a lesser Kingdom has accepted your proposal, you can then pick up goods from their Markets, and they can also pick up goods from yours.")
~
_("If a Kingdom has rejected your proposal, you can try another Kingdom, try the same Kingdom again later, or else harbor a grudge and make them pay for their insult at another time. You may make the same proposal to other Kingdoms until one of them accepts.")
~
_("You're not the only Kingdom that can initiate a treaty proposal. If another Kingdom does so, you will see their message at the bottom of the main screen.")
~
_("If you want to reply to this message, Click on the colored square next to it. This will take you to the Kingdoms Scroll page, where you can Click on either Accept or Reject.")
~
_("If you have established a trade treaty with another Kingdom, you can then pick up any goods you want from their Markets.")
~
_("To do that you will need to hire a Caravan. Since all Caravans are hired in Markets, Click now on your Market.")
~
Button: HIRECARA
_("A Caravan will be hired when you Click on the Hire Caravan Tile. It will stand outside on the South side of the Market.")
~
_("The Hire Caravan Tile will be disabled if you do not have enough Villagers to support your Caravan. Each of your Caravans needs 10 Villagers to support it.")
~
_("If you later lose some of your Village population, you will not lose the Caravans you already hired.")
~
_("Now select the Caravan you've hired.")
~
_("To import goods from a foreign Kingdom, you must send your Caravan to one of their Markets to pick up the goods you want.")
~
_("Note that in the window on the lower right, the First Stop of your Caravan has been set by default to the market where the Caravan was hired. You will want to set the Second Stop as a Market in a foreign Kingdom.")
~
_("To do that, Click on the Set Stop Button in the second row. Your Hand Cursor will change into a Camel & Arrow Cursor. With the new Cursor, Left-Click on a Market in a Kingdom you've established a treaty with.")
~
_("Be sure to choose a foreign Market that is displaying some goods. If the Market is empty, your Caravan will return with nothing.")
~
_("When you Click on a Market, you will be presented with a small list of buttons; these allow you to choose which goods to pick up from that Market.")
~
_("Click on the buttons of the goods you want, making sure that they are goods you're not already producing and selling in your Market.")
~
_("Your Caravan will already be on its way to the foreign Market. When it arrives, it will pick up the selected goods and return to its home Market to drop them off.")
~
_("The foreign Market will make money on the sale of its goods to you, and your Kingdom will also make a profit on the sale of the imported goods to your people.")
~
_("You must understand that you are NOT allowed to drop off any goods in foreign Markets. The goods on sale in Markets are solely under the control of the Kingdoms that built them.")
~
_("If you want to sell your goods to a foreign Kingdom, you can do two things: either wait for their Caravans to come to your Markets and pick up the goods that you have for sale;")
~
_(". . . or build your own Markets within Linking distance of their Villages. Then you can send Caravans to drop your goods off near a foreign Village.")
~
_("To drop off goods, you must first be carrying them. The first row of your Caravan control area is set as your Market. To pick up goods from your Market, you must Click on the small buttons showing what is available there.")
~
_("You will notice that there are two other buttons: A and N. If you Click on A, your Caravan will Automatically pick up your surpluses.")
~
_("If you Click on N, your Caravan will pick up Nothing. This is useful when your route is between a Mine and a Factory, as described below.")
~
_("If you want to choose yourself, Click on the goods you wish to export. Your Caravan will pick up the selected goods from your Market and then drop them off at your Second Stop.")
~
_("When your Kingdom is bigger and you have more than one Village and Market, you can use these techniques to move goods between areas with surplus and areas with shortages.")
~
_("Be sure that the goods you plan to export to your Markets in foreign Kingdoms are not already on sale in that Kingdom's Markets. Foreign people will always buy from their own Markets first, and only buy from you if their Market does not sell what you're offering.")
~
_("If you wish to clear a stop from one of the stops you've chosen, Click on the X Button for that stop. The stop will be cleared, and ready for you to set to another stop. You may, alternately, set a new stop on top of the old one. The old one will be replaced with the new.")
~
_("If you are a bit confused with your routing and wish to see the location of one of the stops you've set, Click on the View Stop Button. When you do so, your main screen will be centered over that stop.")
~
_("If you go to war against a Kingdom you've established a trade treaty with, the treaty will automatically be terminated. You may also terminate a trade treaty at any time by Clicking on the 'Terminate our trade treaty' option under the Kingdoms Scroll /Diplomacy Button.")
~
_("Caravans are also a necessity if you are currently working a Mine beyond direct Linking distance to a Factory. In this case, you'll need to use a Caravan to move the Raw Material from the Mine to the Factory.")
~
_("To do so, first hire a Caravan in one of your Markets.")
~
_("The default first stop for this Caravan is now the Market where you hired it. You should change the first stop, because you will want the Caravan to go from the Mine directly to the Factory.")
~
_("Click on the Set Stop Button in the first row. Using the Camel & Arrow Icon, now Click on the Mine. As you can see, your Caravan has begun to move towards the Mine.")
~
_("You now need to set the Factory as the second stop. Click on the Set Stop Button in the second row and then Click on the Factory where you intend to process the Mine's Raw Materials. Make sure that the Caravan will not pick up any Finished Goods from the Factory by checking that the small Finished Goods Icon is not pressed in.")
~
Button: CHGPROD
_("Because the Factory is beyond direct Linking distance with the Mine, you may have to set the production there manually, to match the Mine's Raw Materials. Do this by Clicking on the Change Production Tile until the Factory's production matches the incoming Raw Material.")
~
_("You may sometimes see Raw Materials for sale in foreign Markets. If you have a trade treaty with those Kingdoms, you will be able to send your Caravans there to pick up those Raw Materials, just as you do with your Mine.")
~
_("You may NOT send a Caravan to a foreign Mine to pick up Raw Materials, even if you have a trade treaty with that Kingdom. All trade must take place through the Market.")
