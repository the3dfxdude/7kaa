_("In these training lessons for Seven Kingdoms we will cover every major aspect of the game. To go to the next or previous page of a lesson, you may either Click on the Arrow Buttons on your screen or you may press the '<' and '>' keys on your keyboard.")
~
_("Every lesson will begin with the game running at the speed of 3. Press higher numbers on your keyboard to make things move faster, or press lower numbers to slow things down. Pressing 0 will pause the game.")
~
_("It is highly recommended that you start with this first training lesson and then go through the rest in order. This is because later lessons will make use of techniques outlined in previous ones.")
~
_("While playing the game, try holding your cursor over any button or icon for a few seconds. This will pause the game and bring up a tooltip, describing the button's or icon's function.")
~
_("You may also wish to set the speed of the game to slower than normal. 0 will pause the game; 9 is the fastest. You may give orders to your units while the game is paused. When the game is started again, the units will carry out their orders.")
~
_("In this training lesson, you will be instructed in the most basic methods of building a prosperous Kingdom and keeping it safe from those who would take it from you.")
~
_("The game begins with the Recruiting of at least one Troop of Soldiers.")
~
_("These Soldiers will be drawn from your first Village, where they are now working their fields as Peasants. Click on your Village with your Hand Cursor.")
~
_("You will now see information on the people resident in your Village in the window to your lower right. Displayed are their total number, the number of Peasants (which should be the same at this time) and their level of loyalty to the King, which will begin the game at 100.")
~
Button: RECRUIT
_("You want to Recruit eight of these Peasants to serve as Soldiers under the King's command. You should therefore Click eight times on the Recruit Tile at the bottom left of the Village Control Area.")
~
_("With each Click, you'll notice that one Peasant has left the Village and is now standing outside. With eight Clicks you should now see eight Peasants milling around, outside the Village.")
~
_("You should also note that with every Click of the Recruit Tile, the Loyalty Level of the village decreases. Be careful to watch your Loyalty Level when Recruiting.")
~
_("The number on the left now displays the present Loyalty Level. The number on the right is the level to which it is increasing or decreasing. The arrow indicates the direction of the movement.")
~
_("You must also be careful to leave enough Peasants in the field, because it is they who grow the food. You can see how much food you have by looking at the number to the right of the bread icon, at the top center of your screen.")
~
_("Group Select the Peasants outside your Village by drawing a selection box around them. Do this by holding down your Left mouse button and then pulling the box around them. Release your mouse button when all eight Peasants are inside the box.")
~
_("Now that the eight Peasants have been selected, order them into the Fort to begin their training. Right-Click your crooked Golden Arrow Cursor on the Fort.")
~
_("Soldiers may only train and increase their Combat Skills in Forts, during battle or while aboard Ships. If there's no General or King in the Fort, no training will take place.")
~
_("You should now train this new Troop to a competent level of Combat Skill. After basic training, they should be just good enough to hold their own in a small battle.")
~
_("To check up on your Peasants' training, Click on the Fort. Inside you will see the King, as well as the eight new Recruits. The King is now training that Troop of eight Recruits in Combat Skills.")
~
_("You'll see a number next to each soldier's picture. This is his Combat Skill, which ranges from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 100.")
~
_("Over time, the Combat Skills of soldiers will increase while they're undergoing training with the King.")
~
Button: PATROL
_("To move your Troops out of your Fort immediately, Click on the Sortie Tile.")
~
_("You can now see the entire Troop, with the King in command, standing outside the Fort. They are already selected and ready to move. The soldiers will all have Sword Icons over their heads. The King will have a Crown Icon.")
~
_("Now it's time to learn a fast and easy way to select an entire group. To illustrate, first Click on the Fort or the Village (anything to de-select the Troops).")
~
_("Now that the Troops are no longer selected, Right-Click on any Soldier of your Troop.")
~
_("As you can see, the entire Troop has been selected again. This is the fastest method of selection; it's especially useful in the heat of battle.")
~
_("If you wish to select a single soldier, you should Click, and not Right-Click on him. You may then direct him anywhere by himself. He will still remain a member of that Troop, unless he is sent into a Fort.")
~
_("To move your selected Troop, Right-Click either on any area of the main screen, or on the small World Map.")
~
_("To order it to disengage from all activity and move to the selected area, Double-Click on that area.")
~
_("To center your main screen over a certain area of the world quickly, Click on that area of the small World Map.")
~
Button: RETCAMP
_("Now you should return the Troop to the Fort for continued training. Do this by Clicking on the Withdraw Tile. If your Fort has been destroyed, this Tile will not be available.")
~
_("You have now completed this training lesson. To go to the next lesson, Click on the Next Training Button. To continue this game as a normal game, Click on the Quit Training Button.")
~
_("If you wish to review a lesson from within any game, Click on the Menu Button at the top right of your screen and then Click on the Training Button. Then select the lesson you want to review. When you Click on the Start Button, the lesson will be overlaid on your present game.")
