_("Your most precious resource, people, may be found in abundant numbers, either in Independent Villages or in enemy Villages. In this lesson you will learn how to capture an Independent Village without the use of force; you'll also learn how to capture an enemy Village with the use of force.")
~
_("We will begin with Independent Villages. The easiest ones to capture are those inhabited by a single nationality, especially if the nationality is the same as your own. To find one quickly, first Click on any Independent Village.")
~
_("You will be able to tell if the Village has a single nationality when you Click on it. For each nationality there will be one row listing the number of people, peasants and their resistance level to your rule.")
~
_("If you have an Independent Village selected, press the left or right arrow key on your keyboard. This will cycle you through all of the Independent Villages in the world.")
~
_("You can judge the nationality of the Villagers by the little picture at the far left of the row. You will also be able to distinguish them by the style of houses in the Village.")
~
_("If you have found an ideal Village, one of your nationality and one relatively close to you, then you may begin the process of absorbing it.")
~
_("You should first send a Construction worker to build a Fort within linking distance of the selected Village.")
~
_("When the Fort is complete, you need to staff it with a commander of high leadership ability. This will cause the Village's resistance to you to decrease rather quickly.")
~
_("If you have no General with high leadership ability, then it is best to use your King. Whichever you use, send him into the new Fort. If you do use your King, be sure to send with him an escort of well-trained troops.")
~
_("With the leader in the Fort, you will see the resistance of the Village decrease. To see this, you must select the Village by Left-Clicking on it.")
~
_("The number displayed on the left in the Village window is the current resistance level. The number on the right is the level to which it is decreasing.")
~
_("When the level decreases to zero, the Village will join your Empire. At the early stages of the game, however, when your reputation is still low, it's unlikely a Village's resistance will decrease to 0, no matter what you do.")
~
Button: GRANT
_("If the Resistance is no longer decreasing, but is not yet 0, you may lower it further by Clicking on the Grant Tile. When you do so, the Village's resistance will decrease by around 10 points. This can be very expensive, especially if the village has a large population, so don't do it until the Resistance level is already quite low.")
~
_("When the Village has raised your flag and become yours, you should probably return your King to his home Fort. You will, however, need to leave a new General in the new Village's Fort.")
~
Button: PROMOTE
_("To make a new General, you need to promote a common soldier. It is by far best to choose the common soldier with the highest leadership level in your army. After he is selected, Click on the Promote Tile.")
~
_("As you can see, the common soldier's Sword Icon has changed into a General's Star. Now send him into the Fort, so that he can begin to exert his control over the new Village.")
~
_("We will now turn to enemy Villages. You can't capture any enemy Villages if enemy Forts are still Linked to them. Your first task must then be to destroy the Forts, if present.")
~
_("When the enemy Fort or Forts have been destroyed, you must build your own, just as you did above. Forts may be built by any soldier, not just by Construction workers.")
~
_("Once the Fort has been built and staffed with a General or your King, the enemy Village should soon acknowledge your rule, and raise your flag. If they take too long recognizing you as lord, exit your Fort and attack the Village. When their resistance falls to zero, return your troops to the Fort. The Village should then surrender.")
