_("You have not acquired knowledge in Weaponry just for the sake of knowledge. You have acquired it to better confound your enemies. Putting this knowledge to use demands that you build a War Factory.")
~
_("A War Factory is built in the same manner as a Factory, and is staffed with the same kind of skilled Manufacturers.")

Button: MAKEWEAP
_("You now want to make a single Weapon. To make a weapon, first select the War Factory you've built, then Click on the Make Weapon Tile.")
~
_("This takes you to the Weapon production area. Click once on the name of the Weapon that you wish to make. That weapon will exit the War Factory as soon as it is finished.")
~
_("You'll probably want to build a large number of weapons simultaneously. To do so, Click on the Make Weapon Tile as before.")
~
_("Now, instead of Clicking on the name of a single Weapon, Click on the number to the right of a Weapon or Weapons until the number you wish to build is displayed. When you are finished, Click on the Done Button.")
~
_("Production of all Weapons will then take place in the order you originally selected them.")
~
_("Weapons, like Soldiers, may be assigned to Forts under the leadership of a General. Unlike Soldiers, however, the Hit-Points of Weapons cannot increase.")
~
_("Weapons combined in a Troop, under a commander, will receive a boost in their effectiveness from the leadership rating of their commander. Once combined into a Troop, they will also be easier to control.")
~
_("Weapons are selected and targeted in exactly the same way as Soldiers. The exception is the Porcupine.")
~
_("A Porcupine is a Weapon designed to be destroyed by your own forces. Send one or -- better yet -- several Porcupines into the midst of the enemy.")
~
_("Now, with a Cannon, Catapult, Spitfire or flaming arrow (Egyptian), target and attack a Porcupine. To do so, first select any other weapon. Then, while holding down the Shift key on your keyboard, Click the Green Hand Cursor on a Porcupine.")
~
_("When your missile hits the Porcupine, it will cause it to explode and start a fire. If you have any other Porcupines adjacent to the one you targeted, it will cause a chain reaction explosion between all of them.")
~
_("This chain reaction can cause great devastation in the ranks of enemy soldiers.")
