_("Your people are your most precious resource. Your success at gaining and keeping their loyalty will play a large part in determining your success in the game.")

_("To see the loyalty of a village or a unit, click on it. After clicking on a village, you will see the loyalty level for each nationality listed on the right.")
~
_("You may also see another number to the right of the loyalty number; this is the level to which it is rising or falling. If there is more than one nationality in your village, you will see the average of the villagers' loyalties listed at the bottom.")
~
_("To judge the loyalty of a unit, click on him. On the right you will see a number representing his loyalty. As with your villages, the loyalty rating may include another number, indicating the level to which loyalty is rising or falling.")
~
Button: GRANT
_("If the loyalty level of one of your villages is too low and you wish to increase it quickly, there are several things you can do. First, when the village is selected, try Clicking the Grant Tile. This will distribute 10 dollars to each villager and increase his loyalty by 10 points.")
~
_("Notice that if you click the Grant Tile repeatedly, the amount of increase in loyalty will reduce; the people are beginning to take the extra money for granted. It is therefore best to wait a while after you Grant money to a village before you do it again.")
~
_("If you have a fort staffed with a General or King and linked to an independent village, you may grant money to these villagers as well. In this case a grant will cost you 30 dollars for each villager. This is one way to lower an independent village's resistance to 0, but it is costly and risky.")
~
Button: REWARD
_("You can increase the loyalty of your individual units in a similar way. To see this, select a unit, other than your King, whose loyalty level is below 100. Now click on the Honor Tile.")
~
_("Giving Honors will pin a medal to your selected unit's chest, and raise his loyalty to your Kingdom. This is especially useful for mercenaries, who have little natural loyalty to your Kingdom. Honors can also be granted to units inside your buildings. To do this, select one of your Buildings. Then choose one unit's picture; then Click on the Honor Tile.")
~
_("The loyalty levels of your people, in villages and out, can be greatly affected by the reputation of your Kingdom. You can see your Kingdom's reputation to the right of the 'Thumbs Up' or 'Thumbs Down' icon at the top of your screen.")
~
_("It will always be to your advantage to have a better reputation than other Kingdoms; a higher reputation will help to keep your people loyal, and will also tend to draw immigrants to your Kingdom.")
~
_("What should you avoid if you want to keep your reputation? Do not attack civilians, do not attack caravans or traders, do not allow your civilians to be killed and do not initiate sneak attacks on your allies or friends.")
~
_("What should you do to help your reputation grow? If you do nothing wrong, your reputation will grow steadily on its own. This assumes that you have a King with a high leadership level. If your King is slain, it is therefore important to give the throne to a soldier with a high leadership level.")
~
_("Another thing you may do to raise your reputation more quickly is to attack Fryhtan Lairs. Everybody respects the extermination of these creatures.")
~
_("What should you avoid if you wish to keep your villagers' loyalty at a high level? Avoid taxing your villagers too much, and avoid recruiting too many peasants too often. It is also important, obviously, not to run out of food.")
~
_("What should you do to help increase your villagers' loyalty? In forts linked to new villages, appoint as General a soldier with a high leadership level. It is just as important to appoint a General of the same nationality as the majority of the people in the village.")
~
Button: PROMOTE
_("To make a new General, you need to promote a common soldier. It is by far best to choose the common soldier with the highest leadership level in your army. After he is selected, Click on the Promote Tile.")
~
_("It is also prudent to make sure your people have access to consumer goods, by having well-stocked markets linked to their villages.")
~
_("You may have noticed that when you send your local troops into the field, the villagers' loyalty decreases. This is because there is no one in the fort to enforce your will. It is wise, therefore, to return your troops to their home fort on occasion.")
~
_("Being away from home also has a negative effect on the loyalty of your troops. As soon as you sortie them from their fort you will see their loyalty decrease. Don't panic. Their loyalty will decrease slowly enough that they'll stay loyal to you while away at battle.")
~
_("If you run out of money, you won't be able to pay your troops. This is a big mistake. If their loyalty falls to 30 or lower, they may change their colors and march off to ally with another Kingdom.")
