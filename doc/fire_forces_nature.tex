\chapter{Fire and the Forces of Nature}

\section{Fire}

Fires, which can be started by lightning, weapons fire, or the wrath of certain Greater Beings, will usually burn for a short while before they go out by themselves. Although they will not spread, there is no action that you can take that will put them out apart from Invoking Thor to bring rain. The length of time that a fire burns will depend on the terrain type and on the weather.

Fires may be put out by Rain or Snow.

If you wish to keep a fire burning, you must help it along with, for instance, Naphtha projectiles from your Catapults.

The effects of fire are many. In a Village, it will kill the people, In a building, it will damage the structure. It will damage all mobile units that it comes in contact with, and it will destroy trees and other plants.

\section{Lightning}

Lightning is a random event. Unless called down by Thor, it will only cause damage when the Random Event Option is enabled.

Lightning can strike and cause damage to units, structures, Villages, and plants.

\section{Earthquakes}

Earthquakes are random events. They will only cause damage when the Random Event Option is enabled.

Earthquakes may damage units that are in Villages or buildings as well as the buildings themselves. Units outside of buildings will be safe from Earthquakes.
% i thought units outside were damaged...
\section{Rain}

Rain will cause no damage, but it will slow down the movement speed of mobile units. Rain will also extinguish fires.

\section{Snow}

Snow, like rain, will cause no damage. It will slow down the movement speed of mobile units. Snow can also extinguish fires.

\section{Tornadoes}

Tornadoes are random events. Unless they are summoned by Thor, they will only appear when the Random Event Option is enabled.
