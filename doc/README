% Greetings reader, my purpose is a complete restoration of the original manual with the updates. Special attention has been given to preserving the original author's voice; Overall, however, this is a different manual with lots of minor and major differences, written with Modern Language Association style guidance and coded in LaTeX with Texstudio on a minimalist Texlive distribution on GNU/Linux and compiled with pdflatex. I welcome fellow community members to contribute to this manual. Signed with gratitude to everyone who put effort in it.

% -- Building the manual  -- %

% Required dependencies:
% * texlive-core
% * texlive-fontsextra - accanthis and universalis
% Optional dependencies:
% * latexmk
% To compile, run:
% $ latexmk or pdflatex 7kaa.tex

    % Changed from textgoth to textswab.
    % REMOVED installation instructions.

    % REMOVED dummy section from FAQ and removed sectioning for bf text.
    % Capitalized chapter titles as per original manual. Previously used M.L.A. style. Contents is not all capitalize like the INDEX in the original.

    % reduced textswab to huge.
    % commented out titlesec code. Recommented and font size reduced to huge.
    % force smallcaps for universalis by defining starting capital letters as \Huge vs. \huge. This has the effect of making the header text buggy. Original manual has the text in small italics instead of bold/etc. Opposing page has Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries in italics. And it does not include sectioning numbering. It is most likely the universalis font. Due to bugs, this is being held off.
    % included recent contributor.
    % README - changed internal and arbitrary versioning to 0.3 to reflect the status of the manual being in its third iteration (7k -> 7kaa -> 7kaa GPLv2).
