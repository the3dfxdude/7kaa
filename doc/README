NOTE: this README is essentially deprecated and will be heavily rewritten once changes I made over the years are reverted to align with a more preservationist method of development. The changelog is no longer needed since I use git more. Any TODO or bugs will be noted in an issue tracker. I will keep some information about dependencies and compiling and also some general style guidance for needed additions to blend in well.

    % Capitalized chapter titles as per original manual. Previously used M.L.A. style. Contents is not all capitalize like the INDEX in the original.

    % reduced textswab to huge.
    % commented out titlesec code. Recommented and font size reduced to huge and 30.
    % force smallcaps for universalis by defining starting capital letters as \Huge vs. \huge. This has the effect of making the header text buggy. Original manual has the text in small italics instead of bold/etc. Opposing page has Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries in italics. And it does not include sectioning numbering. It is most likely the universalis font. Due to bugs, this is being held off.
    % included recent contributor.
    % README - changed internal and arbitrary versioning to 0.3 to reflect the status of the manual being in its third iteration (7k -> 7kaa -> 7kaa GPLv2).
    % Begin using v0.3.2-dev to coincide with 2.15.5-dev in the README.
