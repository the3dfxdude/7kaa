\textswab{\huge{I}}f you want to play a Single Player Game, \textbf{Click} on the Single Player Sword. When you do, you will bring up the following menu: 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{SWsingleplayer} % Original size. center image to mimic original manual
\end{center}

\subsubsection{\textsf{Training}}

\index{game!training}
\index{training}

\textswab{\huge{I}}t is \textbf{\textit{strongly}} recommended that new players begin with the Training section. You may wish to go through all of the Training sessions even before reading the rest of this manual, which has been designed as an in-depth reference book.

When you \textbf{Click} on the Training Sword, you will be taken to a menu listing all of \textit{Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries} Training lessons.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Itraining} % Original size.
\end{center}

\textbf{IMPORTANT}: It is best if you take these lessons in order as later lessons will assume that you understand concepts presented previously.

When you \textbf{Click} on a topic, you will see a brief description of the lesson. If you decide to proceed with the selected lesson, \textbf{Click} on the \textbf{Start Button}.

This will load a predesigned training scenario that will correspond to the chosen lesson.

The lesson text will appear at the top of your screen, leaving plenty of space for you to control the game below.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Ilesson} % Original size.
\end{center}

Page though the lessons by \textbf{Clicking} on the \textless \hspace{1pt} and \textgreater \hspace{1pt} \textbf{Buttons} or do the same by pressing your \textless \hspace{1pt} and \textgreater \hspace{1pt} keys on your keyboard.

It is not strictly necessary that you learn your lessons within the designated training scenario. At any time during any Single Player game, you may load a Training lesson if you wish to review any aspect of the game.

If you wish to proceed to the next lesson while remaining in the same game, \textbf{Click} on the \textbf{Next Training Button}.

To select a lesson that may not be the next in the series, \textbf{Click} on the \textbf{New Training Button}. This will return you to the menu where you can preview and select a different lesson.

\subsubsection{\textsf{New Game}}

\index{game!starting}
\index{new game}

\textbf{\textswab{\huge{C}}licking} on the New Game Sword will take you to the New Single Player Game options screens. Here you will see the four following Options pages:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{Ibasicoptions} % Original size.
\end{center}

On the \textbf{Basic Options} page, you may set your choices for your nationality, color, and the number of computer players.

Other options are also available below. Choose the level of difficulty at which you wish to play and then \textbf{Click} on that button. Level I is the generally the easiest and Level V the most difficult. Setting a level will automatically set corresponding options on the following Advanced Options I and II pages.

The final button "Custom" will be automatically set if you choose any options that do not match with the preset difficulty levels.

Two more options on this page are Terrain style and Land Mass. You will have three choices for each.

On the far right, you can see an area with a number labeled “Difficulty”. This number will rise or fall depending upon the options that you set for the game. The maximum difficulty possible is 200. The difficulty number will be used to determine your final score. A higher difficulty rating means that the possible range of scores will be higher as well.

On the bottom of this options page, there is space for you to type in your name. This name will be used by your King at the start of the game.

On the \textbf{Advanced Options I} page, you will find the following options:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{Iadvancedoptions1} % Original size.
\end{center}

\textbf{World Map}: Here you may choose whether the world will be unexplored at the start of the game, or completely explored with all map features visible.

\begin{changemargin}{0.5cm}{0cm} 
 \textbf{The Map I.D.} is the random-number seed from which your new world map will be generated. If you wish to play with a map that you particularly enjoyed from a previous game, you may enter its number by typing it in on your keyboard. Do not enter the commas that separate the numbers. They are there to make the number easier to read.
\end{changemargin}

\begin{changemargin}{0.5cm}{0cm} 
 If you have already begun a game and wish to check on the Map I.D., \textbf{Click} on the \textbf{Menu Button} at the top right of your screen. The Map I.D. will be on the bottom of the Menu area.
\end{changemargin}

\textbf{Fog of War}: Here you decide whether there is a limit to the distance your units can see (On) or if you will be able to see all activity in the world at any time (Off).

% with which

\textbf{Human’s Treasure}: Sets the amount of money with which you will begin the game.

\textbf{Computer’s Treasure}: Sets the amount of money with which your computer foes will begin the game.

\textbf{Computer’s Aggressiveness}: Sets whether your computer-controlled rivals are passive or aggressive.

\textbf{Fryhtans}: This will determine if Fryhtans are a part of the game or not, and if they are, whether they will only fight to defend themselves, or if they may attack on their own initiative.

% Spacing here is more than in the original.

\begin{changemargin}{.5cm}{0cm}
If set to Defensive, the Fryhtans will remain in their Lairs unless attacked.

If set to Offensive, Fryhtans may attack on their own, especially if a village is settled or a building built too near to their Lair. 

They will also expand their numbers by planting new Lairs around the land.
\end{changemargin}

\textbf{Random Kingdoms}: When this option is turned On, the computer will randomly choose the nationalities of other Kingdoms in the game. It is quite possible, in this case, that other Kingdoms will be of the same nationality as your own. This can make for very interesting games as you vie for control of Independent Villagers who share your nationality.

This setting will also randomize each Kingdom’s initial Village population, including your own. A small population will be somewhat offset by granting a few skilled, mobile units at the start of the game.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{Iadvancedoptions2} % Original size.
\end{center}

On the \textbf{Advanced Options II} page you will find still more options. These are as follows:

\textbf{Natural Resources at Start}: This number, between 1 and 7, will set how many Natural Resources will be spread throughout the world at the start of the game.

\textbf{Natural Resources Nearby?}: This option determines whether or not each kingdom will have a Natural Resource deposit automatically located near its starting village.

\textbf{Independent Villages}: This sets the approximate number of Independent Villages.

\textbf{Independent Village Resistance}: This sets the level of resistance to your rule for all of the Independent Villages. It also influences the Combat abilities of Independent units.

\textbf{New Villages Emerge?}: This determines whether or not new Independent Villages may be settled during the game.

\textbf{New Kingdoms Emerge?}: This determines whether or not new Kingdoms may be founded after the destruction of old ones.

\textbf{Random Events}: This sets the frequency of random natural disasters such as earthquakes, lightning strikes, and tornadoes, all of which can cause damage to buildings and injury to units.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{Igoals} % Original size.
\end{center}

On the \textbf{Goals} page, you will be able to define the victory conditions for your game. The first Kingdom to achieve any of the chosen goals will be the winner.

These goals include the following:

\textbf{Defeat All Other Kingdoms}: This is not an option. Defeating all other Kingdoms always results in victory, because it eliminates any possible competition for other goals. If no other goals are chosen, then victory cannot be achieved without eventually destroying all rivals, even those with whom you may have developed friendships and alliances.

\textbf{Destroy All Fryhtans}: Ridding the world of these vile creatures is a goal that all kingdoms will happily work toward. After the last of them has been destroyed, the kingdom which has dispatched the most Fryhtans will be the winner.

You may view your current score in Fryhtan Battling by \textbf{Clicking} on the Ranking Scroll at the top of your game screen.

\textbf{Achieve a Population of}: This may seem a peaceful goal, but it can often be achieved only through taking Villages by force.

\textbf{Reach an Economic Score of}: Even the lowest possible goal here of 100 will not be achieved unless you are prepared to defend yourself and to take and hold more than one Village and, of course, to prevent your enemies from doing the same. You may check your Economic Score and the scores for the other Kingdoms by \textbf{Clicking} on the Ranking Scroll at the top of your screen and then \textbf{Clicking} on the name of the Kingdom that you want to check. Their Economic Score will appear in the box below.

\textbf{Reach a Total Score of}: Achieving this goal requires a balanced approach to the rulership of one’s kingdom. You may check on your Total Score and that of your rivals in the same way that you checked the Economic Score.

\textbf{Achieve Goal Within}: This will set a deadline for the achievement of the above goals.

\subsection{\textsf{Winning and Losing}}

\index{game!winning and losing}
\index{losing game}
\index{winning game}

\textswab{\huge{Y}}ou will win the game if you achieve \textbf{any} of the chosen goals, and if you have set a time limit, done it before that time limit is reached.

It may come to pass that, having set as your goal something other than the defeat of all of the other Kingdoms, you find a way to destroy all of your rivals anyway. Defeating all other kingdoms is always one of the goals, so you will still win the game in such a case, because the last of your competition has been eliminated.

You will lose the game if your Kingdom is destroyed, if another Kingdom has achieved a set goal, if you have failed to achieve your goal in the set time, or if you have surrendered to another Kingdom.

Even though you have lost, you may continue to observe the progress of the game. The game will continue to run until you decide to Quit, although the score of such a game will be ineligible to be entered in the Hall of Fame.

From these humble beginnings, you must do your best to survive and to prosper through a combination of exploration, training, construction, trade, espionage, diplomacy, and armed conflict.

You will need to develop a variety of skills to be an effective leader and to command the loyalty of your people. Standing in your way will be other kings, evil Fryhtans, and the ravages of nature itself.
