\chapter{\textsf{NATIONALITIES}}

\textswab{\huge{N}}ationalities differ not only in language and costume, but also in fighting skills and methods.

% Hyphenation here.

The Soldiers of all nationalities are well trained in the use of Basic Weapons, which are used for close-in fighting.

Some will acquire the skill of Ranged Weapons only after long years of training and the raising of their Combat Levels. Ranged weapons will then be used as a weapon of first choice. When, however, the enemy closes to fight at melee range, Soldiers will switch back to their Basic Weapons.

Others are expert in defenses that can turn a blade or arrow.

Others will, from time to time, become Berserkers and inflict great damage with a single stroke. This will happen at a set interval but only with units that have been very well trained.

Below you will find a list of the abilities of each nationality.
