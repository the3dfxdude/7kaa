\chapter{The Information Interface}

\index{game!interface}
\index{interface of game}

\textgoth{\Huge{O}}n the top of your screen, you will see all of the information necessary to keep your budding Empire under your firm grip.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Iscrolls} % Original size.
\end{center}

% Keys here.

Beginning on the Left, you will see the Scrolls. \textbf{Click} on a Scroll to see the detailed information inside each. You may also access these Scrolls by pressing the \textbf{F1} through \textbf{F8} keys on your keyboard.

Once you have opened one of these Scrolls, it can be closed by \textbf{Clicking} on it again or by pressing the \textbf{Esc} key on your keyboard.

\section{Kingdoms}

\index{kingdoms scroll}

\textgoth{\Huge{O}}pen this Scroll if you want to see information on all of the world’s Kingdoms that you have discovered so far in your explorations of the world.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{Ikingdoms} % Original size.
\end{center}

Below this area, you will see three buttons that will take you into three different areas. These are \textbf{Information}, \textbf{Diplomacy}, and the \textbf{Diplomatic Log}.

\subsection{Information}

\index{information on the relationship with other kingdom}

\textgoth{\Huge{U}}nder the \textbf{Information Button}, you will see more detailed information on your relationship with the selected Kingdom.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Ikingdoms_information} % Original size.
\end{center}

You will also be able to see the diplomatic relationships that the other Kingdoms have with each other.

For Kingdoms that are your allies, you will be able to see their cash and food reserves as well.

The Yearly Imports and Exports are figured for the preceding 365 days.

\subsubsection{Allow Attack}

\index{allowing attack}

% Use of bold here.

\textgoth{\Huge{B}}y \textbf{Clicking} the \textbf{Yes} or \textbf{No Buttons} in this section, you will be able to manually select whether or not your troops will be allowed to attack units or structures of the selected Kingdom. The game will begin with the default setting of Yes.

The Yes or No option will be set automatically in the following situations:

\begin{changemargin}{.1cm}{0cm} % Larger indent here.

\index{attacking!Allow Attack option}
    
When you form a Friendly or Alliance Treaty with another Kingdom, your Allow Attack option will be automatically set to No. You will be unable to attack any units or structures unless you manually change the setting.

When you enter into a War with a Kingdom, your Allow Attack option will be automatically set to Yes.

If you accept a Cease Fire in a war, the Allow Attack option with the other signatory will be changed to No.
\end{changemargin}

% Hyphenation here.

It would be very wise of you to set the Allow Attack option to No for every Kingdom that you are not planning to attack. This will prevent the sometimes unavoidable incidents of friendly-fire casualties from blowing up into full-scale war. If Allow Attack is set to No, the other Kingdom will understand that any such incident was just a mistake.

% Quotation marks here.

In the bottom chart, you will see a detailed list of your Buildings, including their Building Cost, Number, Yearly Upkeep Cost, and Yearly Income (if any) from that Building. The “Yearly” figures are based on the past 365 days.

\section{State of the Kingdom}

\index{kingdom!state of}
\index{state of kingdom}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Ifoodgoldetc} % Original size.
\end{center}

\textgoth{\Huge{T}}o the right of the Function Scrolls, you will see four icons. These are, on the left: Food and Treasure, and on the right: Date and Reputation.

\subsection{Food}

\index{food}

\textgoth{\Huge{T}}he number in the upper left indicates how much Food is stored in your empire. The number in the parentheses to the right shows how much of a food surplus or deficit you have produced in the past year.

Each person in your kingdom, whether a Peasant, Worker, or Mobile Unit, consumes 10 units of food each year. Remember that food is produced by your Peasants. If you do not keep enough Peasants, you will run out of food. To maintain a constant food supply, you will need one Peasant toiling in the field for every three subjects of your kingdom.

If your Kingdom runs out of food, prepare for the worst. The Loyalty Levels of all of your units will decrease by one point every five days.

You may request to purchase food from other Kingdoms under the \textbf{Kingdoms Scroll/Diplomacy Button}.

\subsection{Treasure}

\index{treasure}

\textgoth{\Huge{T}}he number in the lower left indicates the amount of gold in your treasury. The number in the parenthesis to the right shows how much of a cash surplus or deficit you have incurred in the past year.

It is very important to keep your eyes on your Treasury and your Food supply.

Without money to pay the salaries of your Generals or Mobile units, you will see a decrease in their Loyalty.

% Contraction here.

If you don’t have enough to pay your Spies in foreign Kingdoms, their Loyalty will also decrease. If they are acting as Counterspies in your own Kingdom, you will also need to feed them. If you cannot, their Loyalty will decrease.

If you can no longer pay foreign workers, they will resign.

If you no longer have enough money to maintain your Weapons or Ships, they will begin losing Hit-Points. If the situation continues, they will completely break down.

If you run out of funds, you will no longer be able to maintain your buildings. They will fall into disrepair and eventually collapse.

\subsection{Calendar}

\index{calendar}

\textgoth{\Huge{I}}t is here that you see the day and year. In a multiplayer game, this may become very important when you and your Allies are synchronizing an attack on another Kingdom.

\subsection{Reputation}

\index{reputation}

\textgoth{\Huge{T}}his number represents the esteem in which your Kingdom is held by the people of the world. A high Reputation level can have many and varied benefits during the long struggle for world domination.

Your Reputation may suffer if you persist in actions that other Kingdoms find to be downright antisocial or if you fail to adequately protect your subjects. The following are the various penalties you will pay for your behavior:

% Commas here.

\begin{changemargin}{.5cm}{0cm}
\textbf{If you attack a Kingdom without first declaring war:}

Your Reputation will decrease by 40\% of your target’s Reputation, but only if the target has a positive Reputation.

\textbf{If you declare war on another Kingdom:}

Your Reputation will decrease by 20\% of your target’s Reputation, but only if the target has a positive Reputation.

\textbf{If you terminate an alliance treaty:}

Your Reputation will decrease by 20\% of the target’s Reputation, but only if their Reputation is positive. Note that if you declare war on an ally, your Reputation will decrease twice: once for declaring war and once for terminating an alliance.

\textbf{If you terminate a friendly treaty:}

% Semicolon proper?

Your Reputation will decrease by 10\% of the target’s Reputation, but only if the target has a positive Reputation. Note that if you declare war on a Kingdom with which you have a friendly treaty your Reputation will decrease twice; once for declaring war and once for terminating a friendly treaty.

\textbf{If you terminate a trade treaty:}

Your Reputation will decrease by 5\% of the target’s Reputation but only if the target has a positive Reputation.

\textbf{Additional penalties}

\textbf{-10} points for destroying an enemy Caravan.

\textbf{-10} points for Sinking a Trader.
\end{changemargin}

% extra spacing here.

\begin{changemargin}{1cm}{0cm}
Although Caravels and Galleons may be used for trade, they are armed and may, therefore, be sunk without penalty.
\end{changemargin}

\begin{changemargin}{.5cm}{0cm}
\textbf{-3} points if one of your Caravans is destroyed by an enemy.

\textbf{-3} points if one of your Traders is sunk by an enemy.

\textbf{-3} points if one of your Spies is caught Spying.

\textbf{-1} points for each enemy Civilian collaterally damaged in the defense of their town.

\textbf{-0.3} points for each enemy Civilian collaterally damaged in battle.

\textbf{-0.3} points if one of your Civilians is cruelly murdered by an enemy.

Your Reputation will automatically increase by \textbf{+0.5} points per month, and by even more if you are engaged in battling Fryhtans.
\end{changemargin}

% Contraction here.

Because of the penalties for killing Civilians, you should be very clear on just who is a civilian and who isn’t. If you hold your cursor over an enemy unit and no small icon pops up, you will know that he is a civilian.

You may also view all Troop and Ship movements. \textbf{Clicking} on this button a second time will project those political borders onto the main screen area.

Units of other Kingdoms will try to walk around your borders in their travels. This, of course, does not include Caravans or Soldiers who are coming to attack you.

\subsection{Village View Button}

\index{World Map modes!village view}

\textbf{\textgoth{\Huge{C}}licking} on this button will show you a simplified World Map with all Villages and all buildings clearly displayed. You may also view all Troop and Ship movements. Forested areas will not be shown on this map.
