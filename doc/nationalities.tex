\chapter{Nationalities}

Nationalities differ not only in language and costume, but also in fighting skills and methods.

The Soldiers of all nationalities are well trained in the use of Basic Weapons, which are used for close-in fighting.

Some will acquire the skill of Ranged Weapons only after long years of training and the raising of their Combat Levels. Ranged weapons will then be used as a weapon of first choice. When, however, the enemy closes to fight at melee range, Soldiers will switch back to their Basic Weapons.

Others are expert in defenses that can turn a blade or arrow.

Others will, from time to time, become Berserkers and inflict great damage with a single stroke. This will happen at a set interval---but only with units that have been very well trained.

Below you will find a list of the abilities of each nationality.

\section{Chinese}

Long known for their skills in the martial arts, your Chinese Warriors will give you a well balanced and devastating attack. Striking like serpents with their Long Axes, they are also easily trained as archers who will kill from afar.

The Greek Warrior excels in quick, sharp sword thrusts from behind the safety of his shield. From childhood, he is well schooled in the art of war. Training will introduce no new skills---but will greatly reinforce old ones.
