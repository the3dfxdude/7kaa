\textgoth{\Huge{I}}nns are gathering places used by travelers from around the area. Perhaps exiled from their homelands---or perhaps in search of adventure or gold, these travelers are a mixed bag of skilled mercenaries, accomplished artisans, and Spies.

Your Inns may be placed anywhere; they need not be Linked directly or indirectly with any other building.

\subsection{How to Hire a Mercenary}

\textgoth{\Huge{A}} Mercenary is hired into your service by selecting the Inn and then scrolling down the list of people there. You will see their specialty as well as their level of skill and asking price.

To hire, \textbf{Click} on the person that you are interested in and then \textbf{Click} on the \textbf{Hire Tile} on the bottom left.

These travelers will come and go from the Inn, so if you see nobody of use, make sure to come back later as there is a good chance that you will find what you seek.

It is important to remember that Mercenaries also tend to have a low level of loyalty to your rule. Incentives in the way of Grants or Honors may be called for to raise that level.

\subsection{When to Hire Mercenaries}

\textgoth{\Huge{Y}}ou will notice that you find more people at the Inns in the early years of the game. This reflects the fact that at that time, national allegiances are not well established. It is important, therefore, that you hire some of the best that you can find in the early years of the game.

As time goes on, you will find fewer and fewer good people to hire. You will instead have to concentrate on training your own.
