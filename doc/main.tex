% Greetings reader, my purpose is a complete restoration of the original manual with the updates. Overall, however, this is a different manual with lots of minor differences, written with Modern Language Association style guidance and coded in LaTeX with Texstudio on a minimalist Texlive distribution on GNU/Linux. I tried to let LaTeX do everything automatically, but it isn't perfect nor am I; for I had never used LaTeX, so many errors remain such as the bad box issues I completely ignored unless it was visually disruptive. There is still much to improve. I welcome fellow community members to contribute to this manual. Signed with gratitude to everyone who put effort in it.

% Summary of changes: 

% Stylistic:
	% Corrected gender use and used gender neutrality.
	% Removed ampersands.
	% Removed Oxford commas.
	% Began modifying comma usage for correct usage and personal preference.
	% Began using em dashes. Currently inconsistently used with and without spaces.
	% Replaced/substituted fonts: Galliard with Accanthis and GloudyTextMT with ygothic.
	% Used standard LaTeX chapter heading/counter.
	% Some use (in commands sections) of spacing with "/". - prefered in tech writing these days.

% Formatting:
	% Condensed some sentences into 3 sentence minimum paragraphs -- to correct spacing issues.
	% New manual is a bit longer. Circa 15 pages. Due to sectioning? i-iii etc. pages not counted in the original?
	% Text is aligned. Restore with \raggedright.
	% Some graphics are different sizes due to un/available space. Or increased in size due to poor visability. Some are positioned differently such as centered. Large, centered graphics standardized on .9 width to match .5cm indentation. Original sized varied. Tiles standardized on 0.1 width. - Original size. Some are custom. Other graphics are standard Texstudio input size (.7).
	% More or less whitespace in different locations.
	% Used simple LaTeX header.
	% Used simple LaTeX, non colored, 4in tables. Use of tables for stuff that the original did not use.

% -- Notes and TODO -- %

	% Indexing new content: mChat, website pages, 7kfans multiplayer service, ports, matchmaking, download, Experimental Builds, and cheatcodes. Determine which index entries were changed or removed. Expand on "network play" index entry? Big Letters are missing from index - latexmk?
	% Fix header. - Even manually code.
	% Replace Univers font with Universalis(?) for Chapter titles, TOC, and Index.
	% Restore purple cover.
	% Fix FAQ sectioning and header. - currently using a dummy section.
	% Adjust tables. - more spacing on bottom in \hlines.
	% CODE CLEAN UP.
	% Some tile graphics extend past top textline. _ some due to Huge font.
	% Check chapter references.
	% Organize key/mouse commands alphabetically or functionally. - Boldened in the original.
	% Text in wrapfig env.: bottom text has less space than to the left.
	% Uses in, cm, pt, etc. Use just one type?
	% Perfect Nationalities chapter.
	% "Ancient Adversaries" does not align with the Seven Kingdoms graphic.
	% Include cli commands along with keyboard, mouse, and cheat commands?
	% I changed multi-player to multiplayer spelling, yet singleplayer and single-player are still used.
	% Check gothic font in install instructions.
	% I don't want websites' info in the manual... so far this is 7kfans specific. If the project dies, I will have to fork and change the manual to reflect the new project/websites. Perhaps condense website infos into its own chapter?
	% I just properly capitalized King in the index. - maybe the index is imperfect. index entries are sometimes vague/misleading.
	% the original manual "has been designed as an in-depth reference book."
	% CHeck MLA and the titles' capitalization.
